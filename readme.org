* grapnel - HTTP request for Emacs lib built on curl with flexible callback dispatch

grapnel is an HTTP request library that uses a curl subprocess and
offers flexible callback dispatch. Not only can you pass in an alist
of request outcomes to callback functions (see below) but you can also
override the dispatch function itself if the default one doesn't suit
your needs. Further, grapnel will build the query string, request data
(i.e., POST body), and headers from alists that are passed in.

See the inline docs for more information.

** Installation
*** Via Marmalade (recommended)
Coming soon.  I'm still testing it out, but it has proven pretty
reliable so far.

*** Manually (via git)
Download the source or clone the repo and add the following 
to ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/grapnel")
(require 'grapnel)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage Example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(grapnel-retrieve-url
   url
   `((401 . (lambda (response headers)
              (error "Unauthorized!")))
     (success . ,success-callback)
     (failure . (lambda (response headers)
                  (error "Failed with: %s for %s"
                         (cadr (assoc "response-code" headers))
                         ,url)))
     (error . (lambda (response)
                (error "Error: %s" response))))
   "GET"
   '((some-param . "some-value")))
#+END_EXAMPLE
